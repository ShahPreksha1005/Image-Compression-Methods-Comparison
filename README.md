# Image-Compression-Methods-Comparison
This project compares various image compression techniques, including Huffman Coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), PNG, WebP, JPEG2000, and Bitplane Slicing. It evaluates compression efficiency using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and visualizes results to analyze trade-offs between compression and quality.
